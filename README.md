# Automated Appointment System
## About
Project for EN.645.631.82, an Introduction to Model Based Systems Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Artifacts for the design of an Automated Appointment System.

## Methodology
Development followed the Object Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) with iterative refinement on each activity. OOSEM was tailored to meet our project objectives and contraints. This tailored version of OOSEM  involves 9 basic activities:

1. **Set Up Model:** Establish the models organization. It lays out the modeling convention and standards, ensures consistent representation and style across the model.
1. **Analyze Stakeholder Needs:** An activity to identify stakeholders and their needs. This includes understanding the stakeholders' goals, objectives, and constraints.
1. **Analyze System Requirements:** Specifies the system requirements in terms of its input and output responses and other black box characteristics. This includes identifying functional requirements as well as other constraints.
1. **Define Logical Architecture:** The third step is to define the logical architecture of the system. This development activity decomposes the system into logical parts and defines how they interact. It provides a solution-agnostic view into the problem space.
1. **Synthesize Candidate Physical Architectures:** Allocates the logical parts to physical parts. Defines how the physical parts interact. It provides a ‘solution’ view (i.e. depicts the ‘solution space’).
1. **Manage Requirements Traveability:** This activity helps us track the flow of requirements from their source to their implementation and verification. It is a key part of systems engineering and helps to ensure that the system meets the needs of the stakeholders.
1. **Optimize and Evaluate Alternatives:** Performs engineering analysis that supports system design trade studies and design optimization. Invoked throughout the design process.
1. **Adjust Model Structure:** Natural adjusts to the layout of the system model to account for the logical organization of new system artifacts.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
